# Changelog

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-24

First public release. Native macOS desktop app cloning the open-notebook
research workflow, with Ollama (local) as the only AI provider.

### Features
- Multi-notebook organisation
- Source ingestion: PDF, plain text, Markdown, web URL, Office (docx / pptx / xlsx)
- Background chunking + embedding via Ollama `nomic-embed-text`
- Hybrid retrieval (vector cosine + FTS5 BM25 → Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
- RAG chat with streaming tokens and clickable inline `[N]` citations
- Markdown notes editor (manual + AI-generated from chat / transformations)
- Built-in transformation templates: Summary, Key points, Entities
- First-launch onboarding wizard: detect Ollama, guide install, auto-pull
  preset models (`llama3.2:3b`, `nomic-embed-text`)
- Bilingual UI (English + Czech) with system-locale auto-detect

### Architecture
- Swift Package — `AINotebookCore` library + `AINotebookApp` executable
- Single SQLite file at `~/Library/Application Support/AINotebook/db.sqlite`
- 147 unit tests covering migrations, storage, ingestion, embedding,
  retrieval, chat engine, and transformations

### Known limitations
- Single chat session per notebook (multi-session UI deferred)
- Transformation engine doesn't stream tokens (collects then renders)
- No audio / video ingestion (whisper integration deferred)
- No podcast generation (deferred)
- macOS only; Windows WPF port planned post-v1
